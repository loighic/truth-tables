## truth tables HW 1: MLO & characteristic truth tables

Each problem is worth 10 points, and the whole assignment is worth 100 points. Problems that are submitted late will receive 9 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.  

Be sure to submit each problem. The `âœ“` in the green bar or box indicates that the problem has been checked, not that it has been submitted.

**Part 2**

Complete the truth table. Check it, and when it is correct, submit it.

~~~{.TruthTable .Simple system="magnusSL" options="nocounterexample" points="10" late-credit="9"}
1.5 P & Q
1.6 P -> Q
1.7 P v Q
1.8 P <-> Q
~~~

Identify the main logical operator of (&not;P & Q) and then the main logical operator of any sub-sentences.

1.9 ~P & Q
~~~

You can use the previous problem as a guide for completing this truth table. First, fill in the columns under the atomic sentences. Then, fill in the columns under the logical operators in the ***reverse order*** that you selected them above. (That is, first, fill in the column under the one that you entered last. Then, the one that you entered second-to-last, etc.)

Start from the bottom of the box (above) and fill in the column under each sentence letter and logical operator .
