## truth tables HW 1: MLO & characteristic truth tables

Each problem is worth 10 points, and the whole assignment is worth 100 points. Problems that are submitted late will receive 9 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.  

Be sure to submit each problem. The `✓` in the green bar or box indicates that the problem has been checked, not that it has been submitted.

**Part 1**

Type the main logical operator for the given TFL sentence in the space provided. (Use ~, v, & , ->, and <->.)<br>
Hit `enter` (not &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;).<br> 
Type the main logical operator for the sub-sentence that's in red. Hit `enter`.<br> 
Repeat until finished. (You're finished when the box turns green and the check mark appears).<br>
**Then submit the problem.**

**Part 2**

Complete the truth table. Check it, and when it is correct, submit it.

~~~{.TruthTable .Simple system="magnusSL" options="nocounterexample" points="10" late-credit="9"}
1.5 P & Q
1.6 P -> Q
1.7 P v Q
1.8 P <-> Q
~~~

Identify the main logical operator of (&not;P & Q) and then the main logical operator of any sub-sentences.

~~~{.SynChecker .Match system="magnusSL"  points="10" late-credit="9"}
1.9 ~P & Q
~~~

You can use the previous problem as a guide for completing this truth table. First, fill in the columns under the atomic sentences. Then, fill in the columns under the logical operators in the ***reverse order*** that you selected them above. 

That is, first, fill in the column under the operator that you entered last. Then, fill in the column under the operator that you entered second-to-last, etc.
