## truth tables HW 2

Each problem is worth 20 points, and the whole assignment is worth 100 points. Problems that are submitted late will receive 18 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.

Be sure to submit each problem. The `âœ“` in the green bar indicates that the problem has been checked, not that it has been submitted.
