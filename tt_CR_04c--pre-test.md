## truth tables, chapter 8 assignment (at-home)

Each problem is worth 20 points, and the whole assignment is worth 100 points. Problems that are submitted late will receive 16 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.

Be sure to submit each problem. 

The first one (4.13) can be checked before submitting. The other five (4.14 - 4.18) cannot be checked. (Checked by Carnap, that is. You can and should check and double-check them before submitting.)
