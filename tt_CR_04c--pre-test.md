## truth tables, chapter 8 assignment (at-home)

---

<span style="color:blue">**Do this alone, and don't discuss it with anyone who hasn't done it.**</span>

Be sure to submit each problem. 

The first truth table can be checked before submitting. The other five (4.02 - 4.06) cannot be checked. (Checked by Carnap, that is. You can and should check and double-check each of them before submitting.)

Some of the truth tables that you'll do on test 2 won't have the Carnap check feature.
