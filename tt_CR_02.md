The whole assignment is worth 102 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.

**You have plenty of time. Don't rush. Work as a group.**

**Make sure that everyone in your group (all three or four of you) understands how to do the problems and has completed each pair before you move on to the next pair.**

You can use the previous problem as a guide for completing this truth table. First, fill in the columns under the atomic sentences. Then, fill in the columns under the logical operators in the ***reverse order*** that you selected them above. 

That is, first, fill in the column under the operator that you entered last. Then, fill in the column under the operator that you entered second-to-last, etc.
