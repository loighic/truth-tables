## truth tables, assignment 2 (in-class)

The whole assignment is worth 102 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.

**You have plenty of time. Don't rush. Work as a group.**

**Make sure that everyone in your group (all three or four of you) understands how to do the problems and has completed each pair before you move on to the next pair.**

---

Use these instructions for the odd numbered problems:

Type the main logical operator for the given TFL sentence in the space provided. (Use ~, v, & , ->, and <->.)<br>
Hit `enter` (not &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;).<br> 
Type the main logical operator for the sub-sentence that's in red. Hit `enter`.<br> 
Repeat until finished.<br>
**Then submit the problem.**

For the even numbered problems, complete the truth table. Be sure to submit each one. The `âœ“` in the green bar indicates that the problem has been checked, not that it has been submitted.
