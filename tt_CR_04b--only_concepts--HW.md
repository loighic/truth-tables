## truth tables, chapter 9 assignment (at-home)
 

For the truth tables, determine the truth values for each sentence or pair of sentences. Each of the multiple choice questions is about the truth table right before it. **The multiple choice questions can only answered once, and, except for the first one, they cannot be checked.** 

Be sure to submit each problem. The `âœ“` in the green bar indicates that the problem has been checked, not that it has been submitted.
