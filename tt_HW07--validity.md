## truth tables HW 7

Each problem is worth 20 points, and the whole assignment is worth 100 points. Problems that are submitted late will receive 16 points. Your grade will be put on a 10 point scale when it is posted in Canvas.

For 7.1, determine the truth values for each sentence, and then indicate whether the line is a good or a bad one by putting a `✓` or an `✗` under the turnstile. 

For 7.2 - 7.5, just indicate whether the line is a good or a bad one by putting a `✓` or an `✗` under the turnstile.
